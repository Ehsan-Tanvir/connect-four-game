# Connect Four Game

## 🎮 About the Project
This is a simple **Connect Four** game implemented in C++. It allows two players to take turns and drop their tokens into a 4x4 grid, aiming to connect four of their pieces in a row, column, or diagonal to win the game.

## 📌 Features
- Two-player mode with **turn-based gameplay**
- **Randomized coin toss** to decide who starts
- Input validation to prevent invalid moves
- **Win detection** for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal connections
- **Draw detection** in case the board is full
- Console-based UI for simple and effective gameplay

## 🛠️ How to Run
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- A C++ compiler (GCC, MSVC, Clang, etc.)

### Steps to Compile and Run
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Ehsan-Tanvir/connect-four-game.git
   cd connect-four
   ```
2. **Compile the code**:
   ```sh
   g++ connect_four.cpp -o connect_four
   ```
3. **Run the game**:
   ```sh
   ./connect_four
   ```

## 📝 How to Play
1. Start the game and **choose an option** from the menu.
2. Players **take turns** entering a column number (0-3) to drop their token.
3. The game checks for a **win condition** or a **draw**.
4. The first player to **connect four** of their pieces in a row, column, or diagonal **wins**!
5. If the board is full with no winner, it's a **draw**.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Expand the board size to **6x7** for a more traditional experience
- Add a **GUI version** with better visuals
- Implement **AI mode** for single-player gameplay
